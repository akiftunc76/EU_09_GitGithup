Bismillah. This is the start of my book

Java is cool

James Bond is always with us

Do I have a local repository?


Do I have a git?

VCS den ilerledik Git i sectik.

We made a local Repository

Repository is just a folder that git keeps track of changes
Local Repository is on our computer (hidden.git folder)
Remote Repository on [Githup.com]

Where we said VCS before should now say Git and have some new options
Our files get some coloring, This is normal
Red file is un-versioned
Green actively changed and ready to be part of a repository

After I push commit, I have my changes in my local repository.
